abstract: "The IEEE VIS conference took place last week in Atlanta, Georgia. The conference is, as they note on their website (http://ieeevis.org), \"the premier forum for advances in scientific and information visualization.\" There are separate sessions for scientific visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics. Additionally, a number of symposiums and workshops are co-located, including ones that focus on visual tools for text analytics, biological data visualization, and visualization for large-scale data. This year I was a chair of the Arts Program, VISAP, and led a papers session for artists and researchers to present on topics related to connections between arts and visualization (http://visap2013.sista.arizona.edu). In this talk I will provide an overview of topics and themes from the conference, highlighting interesting presentations and papers that are representative of current ideas in visualization research."
