abstract: "The problem of efficient, interactive foreground/background seg- mentation in still images is of great practical importance in im- age editing. Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) infor- mation, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for border matting has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."
