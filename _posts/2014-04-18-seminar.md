This talk will cover two papers on optimizing Markov random fields in computer vision.  

In Boykov et al.'s influential 2001 PAMI paper, "Fast Approximate Energy Minimization via Graph Cuts," the authors present two methods for updating large regions of labels simultaneously using graph-cuts: alpha expansion and beta swap.  These methods are both more efficient than single-site update methods, and are more effective at avoiding local minima.

Szeliski et al.'s 2008 survey of MRF minimization methods investigates several computer-vision applications, and compares Boykov's graph-cuts methods against two other techniques: loopy belief propagation and tree re-weighted message passing (TRW-S).  I will focus mostly on the graph-cuts and applications parts of this paper.
