title: "An Analysis-Synthesis Approach to the Creative Processing of Video Signals"
abstract: "Analysis and synthesis (A/S) approaches are common in multimedia signal
processing.  The community of audio artists have adopted (A/S) techniques as an important part of their arsenal of technological tools for the creative manipulation of sounds. Tools such as the tracking phase vocoder allow musicians to manipulate pitch and duration independently or to combine two signals in exotic ways (cross-synthesis). However, a similar emphasis has yet to be pursued for the creative manipulation of video signals.
This talk describes how (A/S) approaches can potentiate the narrative possibilities of video signals. Alternatives to overcome problems like temporal coherence and interpretations of concepts like cross- synthesis of two video signals are also presented."
