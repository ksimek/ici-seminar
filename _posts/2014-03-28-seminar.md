abstract: "We present a technique for separating foreground objects from the background in a video. Our method is fast, fully au- tomatic, and makes minimal assumptions about the video. This enables handling essentially unconstrained settings, including rapidly moving background, arbitrary object mo- tion and appearance, and non-rigid deformations and ar- ticulations. In experiments on two datasets containing over 1400 video shots, our method outperforms a state-of-the- art background subtraction technique as well as meth- ods based on clustering point tracks. Moreover, it performs comparably to recent video object segmentation methods based on object proposals, while being orders of magnitude faster."
