presenter: Jinyan Guan and Kyle Simek
abstract: Jinyan and Kyle will be sharing what they learned at last week's training workshop on the El Gato supercomputer system.  In the first half of the seminar, Jinyan will be giveing an interactive tutorial on CUDA, in which we will write, compile, and run CUDA code on V11.  Don't forget to bring your laptops!  In the second half, Kyle will show how to expliit the SIMD architecture of modern CPU's to achieve significant speedups on a single core.  We'll also see how to combine SIMD and traditional multi-core parallelism with OpenMP to acheive massive speedups with just a few lines of code.
