abstract: "Visual exploration of multidimensional data typically requires projection onto lower-dimensional representations. A large number of possible projections has been proposed in the recent years. The analysis of multidimensional data has been studied in various research areas for many years and different quality measures have been introduced to help in the interpretation of sets of points in a multidimensional space. Different measures deliver different visual metrics to evaluate the best views of multidimensional datasets that do not necessarily match the expectations of human perception. This thesis contributes toward this goal by providing some perceptual guidelines through investigating different projections. Learning more about the effectiveness of projection layouts from a userâ€™s perspective is an important step towards consolidating their role in supporting visual analytics tasks. Such tasks often involve detecting and correlating clusters. This thesis supports discovering certain characteristics that change the visual attention and cognitive process for finding clusters, patterns, outliers, and relationships."
