Anh will start by presenting his new research for inferring the mental states of participants in short videos.  If there's time we may hear from Clay on recent progress on the Bayesian Blackboard project, or from Jeremy on his work relating language to visual cues.

The talks will be informal, and there may be some good opportunities for discussion and sharing of ideas.
