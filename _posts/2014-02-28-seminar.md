abstract: 'Shadows encode a powerful geometric cue: if one pixel
casts a shadow onto another, then the two pixels are col-
inear with the lighting direction. Given many images over
many lighting directions, this constraint can be leveraged
to recover the depth of a scene from a single viewpoint.
For outdoor scenes with solar illumination, we term this the
episolar constraint, which provides a convex optimization
to solve for the sparse depth of a scene from shadow cor-
respondences, a method to reduce the search space when
finding shadow correspondences, and a method to geomet-
rically calibrate a camera using shadow constraints. Our
method constructs a dense network of nonlocal constraints
which complements recent work on outdoor photometric
stereo and cloud based cues for 3D. We demonstrate results
across a variety of time-lapse sequences from webcams “in
the wild.”'
