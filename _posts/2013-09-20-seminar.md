title: "Convolution Kernels for Natural Language"
abstract: "We describe the application of kernel methods to Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems. In many NLP tasks the objects being modeled are strings, trees, graphs or other discrete structures which require some mechanism to convert them into feature vectors. We describe kernels for various natural language structures, allowing rich, high dimensional representations of these structures. We show how a kernel over trees can be applied to parsing using the voted perceptron algorithm, and we give experimental results on the ATIS corpus of parse trees."

Agenda
=======

Mihai will present this seminal paper on convolutional kernels in natural language processing from NIPS 2001.

Time permitting, we will also cover another paper on convolutional kernels from EMNLP 2009:
