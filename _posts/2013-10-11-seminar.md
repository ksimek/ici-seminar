Colin will present his recent work on inferring captions for scenes.

This work is still in development, but Colin has provided two sources that provide some background.  The first is his previous paper from ICDL 2013:
    
[A generative probabilistic framework for learning
spatial language ]({site.base_url}/docs/ICDL2013.pdf). Colin R. Dawson, Jeremy Wright, Antons Rebguns, Marco Valenzuela Escarcega, Daniel Fried and Paul R. Cohen.

The second is a related paper on probabilistic parsing by Michael Collins.
    
[Three Generative, Lexicalised Models for Statistical Parsing]({site.base_url}/docs/Three_Generative_Lexicalized_Models_for_Statistical_Parsing.ps). Michael Collins.
